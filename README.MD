## Problem: 

How many of us have struggled with the chaos of trip planning? Multiple websites, scattered notes, and disorganized information - it can be overwhelming.

This is where "Tripy" comes in. It's your all-in-one solution for seamless trip planning and journaling. With Tripy, you can keep everything in one place, making your travel experience stress-free and enjoyable.



## Features:

The app allows users to perform the following tasks:

    1) Add Places: Users can fill in the information in a form that generates a place-card of where the user wants to visit.

    2) Update Budgets: Users have the ability to update allocated budgets that plan to make for each trip.

    3) Delete Place-cards: Users can delete place-cards generated whenever they have either visted the desired location or have no interest in visiting the location anymore.
